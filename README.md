## Proof of Paint
Claim, protect, and get rewarded for your street art.

### Problem

Thousands of talented street artists go unrecognized, have their work removed permanently, or, even worse, have [copycats impersonate them](https://artlyst.com/news/copycat-banksy-graffiti-flood-uk-mainland/).

### What we built

We built a <u>decentralised</u> street art gallery where artists can <u>anonymously</u> upload photos of their work and location to the chain. They can then claim ownership and receive blockchain-based payments. This:

1. Protects artists from copycats
2. Gives street artists a platform to showcase their work and get paid
3. Most importantly, lets users explore the art and culture around them

### Demo

### FAQ

**Surely this exists already?**

We looked and looked but couldn't find anything that addresses our problem with street art.

NFTs donâ€™t solve this problem because:

- People want to tip the artist directly not buy an NFT.
- Charity wallets could be linked to artist aliases, supporting artwork targeting charity and political causes.
- Artists would benefit directly if their work gains popularity online.
