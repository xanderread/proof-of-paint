### Problem 💭

Thousands of talented street artists go unrecognized, have their work removed permanently, or, even worse, have [copycats impersonate them](https://artlyst.com/news/copycat-banksy-graffiti-flood-uk-mainland/).

### What we built 👨‍💻

We built a street art gallery <u>dApp</u> where artists can be authed <u>anonymously</u> and choose aliases. They can upload photos of their work and location to the chain and claim ownership. Through our platform users can explore trending street art around them and tip the artists through their crypto wallet. This:

1. Protects artists from copycats
2. Gives street artists a platform to showcase their work and get paid
3. Lets users explore the art and culture around them

The app is built on ICP ♾️, taking advantage of the low-cost, massive storage and easy to use iid auth-client. 

> Backend is all Motoko, Frontend: React

### FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Why NFTs don't solve this problem</strong></summary>

- We want to support the artist of the cool street art we walk past everyday...not buy an NFT.
- We want to find the art and culture around us.
- Thousands of NFT street art collections have wrongly been created and sold without the artist's permission, [as seen with Banksy's work](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-58399338#:~:text=Banksy's%20team%20told%20the%20BBC,actual%20artwork%20or%20its%20copyright.), leading to a lack of trust in the NFT market.
